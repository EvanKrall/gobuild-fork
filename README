Description
------------
gobuild is an automatic build tool that aims to replace Makefiles for simple
projects written in the Go programming language. It creates a dependency graph
of all local imports and compiles them in the right order using the gc Go
compiler.


Compiling
----------

> 6g gobuild.go && 6l -o gobuild gobuild.6

Replace 6 with whatever your architecture is (6 = AMD64, 8 = 386, 5 = arm).

If you have an older version of gobuild, running gobuild without parameters
inside the source code directory should be enough.


Usage
------

There are currently three different use cases for gobuild.

1) One main function with one or more file in the main package:
   
   > gobuild

2) Several main functions in different files with each file of the main
   package belonging to a different executable:

   > gobuild mainfile.go

3) Several main functions in different files and some additional files in the
   main package that are shared by some/all the executables:

   > gobuild --multiple-main mainfile.go

For gobuild to work correctly you have to import all local packages with their
path, e.g. import "./mypackage";. All files for this package should be placed
inside a directory called "mypackage", but it also works if they are in the
root directory. For packages with a deeper directory structure the correct path
is required though.


Parameters
-----------

> gobuild [options] [gofile]

 gofile
        For building an executable this file must have a main function inside.

 -o filename
        If compiling an executable it will be written to this file. Without
        this parameter the executable will have the same name as the go-file
        with the main function, excluding the file extension.

 -q
        Quiet mode, only print warnings and errors.
 -qq
        Quieter mode, only print errors.
 -v
        Verbose mode, print debug messages.
 -multiple-main
        Include other files to the main package if they don't have a main
        function. This can include files that are not required.
 -include-hidden
        Include files in hidden directories and hidden files.
