Compiling
----------

> 6g gobuild.go && 6l -o gobuild gobuild.6

Replace 6 with whatever your architecture is (6 = AMD64, 8 = 386, 5 = arm).

If you have an older version of gobuild, running gobuild
without parameters inside the source code directory
should be enough.



Usage
-----

There are currently three different use cases for gobuild.

1) One main function with one or more file in the main package:
   
   > gobuild

2) Several main functions in different files with each file of
   the main package belonging to a different executable:

   > gobuild mainfile.go

3) Several main functions in different files and some additional
   files in the main package that are shared by some/all the
   executables:

   > gobuild --multiple-main mainfile.go

Local imports will be compiled automatically. They should be placed
inside directories that match their package name.
