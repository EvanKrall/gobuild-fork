 - build >1 target with command line arguments or -a switch
 - command line options (package and -o dir) for librarys
 - local imports without "./" (seems to be really common)
 - change root path if command line to main file is in a different (non-sub) directory
 - support for external librarys (e.g. OpenGL/SDL or additional go libs without .go files?)
 - testing (-t)
 - differ between packages with same name but different paths (error?)
 - BUG: if package file is in 2 sub-dirs with wrong names, compilation fails
 - (optional) colorize errors/warnings
 - exclude command line parameter -X (for files/filemasks/directories)
 - automatic build repair (react on some compile/link errors)
 - Makefile creator
 - --clean command line option (is this needed?)
 - support gccgo
