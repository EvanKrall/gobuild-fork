 - local imports without "./" (seems to be really common)
 - Makefile for initial build + installing into $GOBIN
 - change root path if command line to main file is in a different (non-sub) directory
 - split gobuild.go into several files
 - support for external librarys (run cgo and figure out include paths? might need gobuild.hint first)
 - testing (-t)
 - differ between packages with same name but different paths (error?)
 - BUG: if package file is in 2 sub-dirs with wrong names, compilation fails
 - (optional) colorize errors/warnings
 - exclude command line parameter -X (for files/filemasks/directories)
 - automatic build repair (react on some compile/link errors)
 - gobuild.hint file
 - (optional) Makefile creator
 - make the -clean option safer (error if wrong permissions, no .go files, etc.)
 - support gccgo
 - Windows support
